# Sentiment-Analysis
# Overview <br>
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data to determine whether the expressed opinion in a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis is conducted using various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.Among the models used, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has shown the best performance.

# Installation <br>
1) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dikshasinghhh/sentiment-analysis.git 
cd sentiment-analysis
```
2) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```
3) Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Dataset <br>
The dataset used for this project contains textual data labeled with sentiment categories. the dataset has been included in the repository.
<br>
# Model Training <br>
We use various machine learning algorithms including:
<br>
1) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) <br>
2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) <br>
3) Other classification models <br>
4) The SVM model has provided the best results. <br>

# Evaluation <br>
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as confusion matrix. The evaluation script generates a detailed report of the model's performance, including a confusion matrix to visualize the classification results.
<br>
# Results <br>
The final SVM model achieves the best performance among all the models tested.
